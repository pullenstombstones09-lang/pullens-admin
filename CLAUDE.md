|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) — RLS, real-time |
| Auth | Supabase Auth — PIN login, bcrypt hashed |
| Storage | Supabase Storage — photos, PDFs, documents |
| Hosting | Vercel — auto-deploy from GitHub |
| AI | Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-6) — HR Advisor only |
| Icons | lucide-react (SVG only, no emoji) |

## Business Entity

- Legal: Amazon Creek Trading (Pty) Ltd t/a Pullens Tombstones
- Reg: 2011/105461/23, COID: 990001280518, UIF: 2573997/9
- 38 employees, 7 admin users (Cheryl added 5 May 2026)

## Locked Decisions

1. Separate from YeboPro — own Supabase org, own repo, own Vercel project
2. PIN auth — 4-digit, bcrypt hashed, force-change on first login
3. Payroll formula — matches V12 spreadsheet exactly
4. Late rules — grace 5min, 08:06-08:15=dock 30, 08:16-09:00=dock 60, 09:01+=actual minutes missed (owner can override)
5. Petty cash cutoff — Thursday 16:00 SAST
6. NMW — R30.23/hr (March 2026)
7. Profile-first UI, Tablet-first (48px touch targets)
8. Pay week = Monday 00:00 → Friday 16:00. Friday after 16:00 = OT, rolls into next week
9. OT only kicks in after 40 hours total for the week (45 for sales staff)
10. Saturday payroll is a separate cash run (type: saturday_cash)
11. Per-employee approval gate before payroll generates (default all approved)
12. Royal blue (#1E40AF) primary + gold (#C4A35A) accent — no charcoal
13. Payroll runs from ONE place only — the Payroll page. Review page is for editing/previewing only.
14. One standard payslip PDF design used everywhere (Print All, Signing, Individual preview)
15. OT is auto-derived from attendance (Mon-Thu past 17:00, Fri past 16:00, Sat past 13:00 for sales). The `overtime_requests` approval flow is retained as a table but unused by the engine. (14 May 2026)
16. Sales staff normal week = Mon-Thu 9h + Fri 8h + Sat 9-1 (4h) = 44h ordinary, paid `weekly_wage / 44`. PT008, PT012, PT023, PT024, PT028, PT032. (14 May 2026)
17. NMW enforcement: engine throws on `weekly_wage / weekly_hours < R30.23`; DB constraint `chk_nmw` mirrors this. Min wage at /44 = R1330.12. (14 May 2026)
18. Friday past 16:00 = OT for NEXT week, persisted in `friday_ot_rollovers` table with explicit `applied_to_run_id` + `produced_by_run_id` lineage. (14 May 2026)

## ✅ RESOLVED 14 May 2026 — 4-8 May Payroll Discrepancies (Issues 1, 3, 5)

Issues 1 + 3 + 5 below were resolved by the payroll-engine-v2 rewrite shipped 14 May 2026 (commit `b7d32d1`). The new engine auto-derives OT from attendance, removes the never-used overtime_requests approval gate, treats sales staff as 44h ordinary (Mon-Sat) with /44 hourly rate, raises Nicolette/Faith/Gugu/Zandile to R1340 for NMW compliance, and persists Friday-past-16:00 rollover via the new `friday_ot_rollovers` table. The 4-8 May payroll run was NOT recalculated — it stays as-is per Annika's instruction "ignore the past, fix it going forward".

**Still open from the URGENT FIX SPEC:**
- **Issue 2 (loans table not populated)** — separate spec needed. The 13 Excel loan deductions for the week were never applied because the `loans` table is empty. Decision needed: back-load historic loans or write off.
- **Issue 4 (one-off anomalies)** — Tumelo/Randhir absent in Excel but paid in app; Aaron R13.71 rounding diff; Lungiswa parked. Verify with bookkeeping.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-payroll-engine-ot-and-sales-rate-design.md`
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-14-payroll-engine-ot-and-sales-rate-plan.md`

## 🔴 LEGACY — 4-8 May Payroll Discrepancies (added 14 May 2026, superseded by engine v2)

**Source of truth for comparison:** `C:\Users\Annika\Downloads\V12_ALLANDALE NEW 4 - 8 MAY.xlsm` (Excel) vs payroll_run `4e62b415-3cc9-44c7-81c9-f44708124c7a` in Supabase (app, status=generated, run_at 2026-05-11). App paid total net **R51,291.71** vs Excel's ~R47,500. The 38 payslips diverge in three systemic ways plus several one-offs. **App was NOT recalculated or modified — payslips remain as generated 11 May.**

### Issue 1 — Overtime hours absent from the app run
Excel logged OT for 8 employees this week; app shows 0 OT for all of them. Either the attendance register never had Friday-after-16:00 / >40h captured, OR the payroll engine isn't pulling OT from the register correctly. Affected employees and their Excel OT hours:

| PT Code | Name | Excel OT hrs |
|---|---|---|
| PT010 | Sibusiso Mdawe | 6.00 |
| PT013 | Alli Yessa | 6.25 |
| PT014 | Enrique Munien | 1.25 |
| PT017 | Cosmos Mkhize | 3.25 |
| PT025 | Sinethemba Kweshube | 6.25 |
| PT030 | Sifiso Ndlela | 7.75 |
| PT033 | David Mtshali | 1.25 |
| PT038 | Nhlanhla "Lucky" Ndlovu | 5.50 |

**To do:** check attendance register for week 4-8 May for these staff. If hours are there, payroll engine OT detection is broken (decision #9: OT after 40h / 45h). If hours are missing, register data entry skipped them.

### Issue 2 — Loan deductions not applied
Excel deducted loans from 13 employees totalling ~R1,800. App applied loans to only 3, and amounts don't match Excel. App-missed loan deductions:

| PT Code | Name | Excel L- (R) |
|---|---|---|
| PT003 | Sipho Mthembu | 30 |
| PT006 | Nkululeko Miya | 200 |
| PT011 | Lindokuhle Khanyile | 100 |
| PT015 | Cherylette Rengan | 100 |
| PT018 | Thabiso Msindo | 150 |
| PT019 | Ayanda Mhlongo | 20 |
| PT023 | Faith Nxele | 200 |
| PT026 | Philani Mkhize | 200 |
| PT031 | Xolani | 100 |
| PT032 | Zandile Mchunu | 100 |
| PT034 | Mlindeni Lamula | 200 |
| PT036 | Philani Rasta | 100 |

App also has its own loans not in Excel: Junior R100, Enrique R75 (Excel had R100). Root cause likely the `loans` table is not populated — Excel loan ledger never migrated into the app.

**To do:** (a) confirm whether loans table is populated for these employees, (b) decide whether the historic Excel loans should be back-loaded or written off, (c) once decided, recalculate the 4-8 May run.

### Issue 3 — 45-hour sales staff: hourly-rate divisor mismatch
**Conflict between locked decisions #9 and what Excel actually does.** Decision #9 says "OT only kicks in after 40 hours total for the week (45 for sales staff)" — app implements rate = weekly_wage ÷ 45 for sales staff. Excel divides by 40 for everyone.

Impact for 4-8 May (sales staff who worked their normal hours):

| PT Code | Name | Wage | App rate (÷45) | Excel rate (÷40) | App paid | Excel paid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PT008 | Marlyn Naidoo | 1451.13 | R32.25/h | R36.28/h | 1284.98 | 1436.62 |
| PT012 | Nicolette David | 1250.00 | R27.78/h | R31.25/h | 1106.88 | 1237.50 |
| PT023 | Faith Nxele | 1210.00 | R26.89/h | R30.25/h | 1071.46 | 1010.00 |
| PT024 | Gugu Cele | 1210.00 | R26.89/h | R30.25/h | 1071.46 | 1197.90 |
| PT028 | Randhir Singh | 1820.00 | R40.44/h | R45.50/h | 1611.61 | 0 (absent) |
| PT032 | Zandile Mchunu | 1300.00 | R28.89/h | R32.50/h | 1151.15 | 1057.30 |

**Two problems:**
1. **NMW breach** — Nicolette R27.78, Faith/Gugu R26.89, Zandile R28.89 are ALL below national minimum wage R30.23/hr (March 2026, per CLAUDE.md). This is a legal exposure.
2. **Pay drop vs Excel** — sales staff used to Excel amounts will see their take-home drop ~11%.

**Decision needed from Annika before fixing:**
- **Option A:** Keep app's wage÷45 logic and raise sales wages so wage÷45 ≥ NMW (e.g. Nicolette wage needs to be ≥ R1,360 for compliance).
- **Option B:** Change rate logic to wage÷40 for everyone, and the 41st-45th hours are paid as additional hours at ordinary rate (no premium until >45h).
- **Option C:** Change rate logic so sales staff get wage÷40 for first 40h and wage÷40 for hrs 41-45 (still ordinary), OT premium >45h. This matches Excel behaviour and the spirit of decision #9.

### Issue 4 — Specific one-offs to verify
- **Tumelo Lebofa (PT021):** App paid R464.19 for 15.5h. Excel paid R0. Was he at work? Attendance register vs reality.
- **Randhir Singh (PT028):** App paid R1,611.61 for 40.25h. Excel paid R0 (absent). Same question.
- **Lungiswa Mpambane (PT039):** In app, not in Excel. Confirm she's a real employee and Excel just hadn't been updated. Already on parked list — anomaly noted.
- **Aaron (PT001):** Hours diff 37.50 (app) vs 37.25 (Excel). App overpaid R13.71. Trivial, but indicates rounding inconsistency.

### Issue 5 — Hours rounding inconsistency
App rounds attendance to ~5-minute increments (0.083h); Excel rounds to 15-min (0.25h). Decide on a single rule and apply in the register. Recommended: 15-min rounding matches the BCEA late-rule grace bands (decision #4).

### What to do when resuming
1. **Do NOT auto-recalculate the 4-8 May run yet.** Decisions #9 (sales rate divisor) and the loan back-load question both need Annika's call. Recalculating would lock in whichever direction is chosen.
2. Open this section, work top-down: Issue 1 (OT data) → Issue 2 (loans table state) → Issue 3 (sales staff decision) → Issues 4-5 (one-offs + rounding).
3. Once decisions are made, use the existing **Recalculate** button on the Payroll page (it deletes old run + payslips and regenerates). Already built per 7 May session notes.
4. After fix, run a parity test against the V13 spreadsheet for one more week before considering Excel retired.

### Files involved
- Payroll engine: `src/lib/payroll-engine.ts`
- Payroll API: `src/app/api/payroll/run/route.ts`, `src/app/api/payroll/recalculate/route.ts`
- Loans table: schema in `supabase/migrations/00002_create_core_tables.sql`
- Attendance: register page `src/app/(dashboard)/register/`

## Status — 14 May 2026 (session complete)

### SESSION WORK (14 May) — payroll engine v2

Branch `payroll-engine-v2` merged into `main` at commit `b7d32d1`, pushed to GitHub. Vercel auto-deploys.

**Engine rewrite** (`src/lib/payroll-engine.ts`):
- Replaced approval-gated OT (via `overtime_requests` table, never used) with attendance-derived OT.
- Mon-Thu past 17:00, Fri past 16:00 → candidate OT for the week.
- Sales staff Sat past 13:00 → candidate OT (Sat 9-1 is ordinary).
- OT premium 1.5× triggers only when weekly total ≥ threshold (40 factory / 44 sales). Below threshold, past-end hours pay ordinary.
- Friday past 16:00 → rolled to next week via new `friday_ot_rollovers` table.
- NMW guard throws if `weekly_wage / weekly_hours < R30.23`.
- Removed: `splitFridayHours`, `DEFAULT_DAILY_HOURS_*`, `calculateHoursWorked`.
- New helpers: `normalEndMinutesForDay`, `dailyQuotaHoursFor`, `toMinutes`.
- 19 unit tests added (vitest), all passing.

**Sales staff change:**
- `weekly_hours` 45 → 44 for PT008, PT012, PT023, PT024, PT028, PT032.
- Wages uplifted to R1340 for the four under-NMW staff: Nicolette (PT012), Faith (PT023), Gugu (PT024), Zandile (PT032).
- Normal sales week now = Mon-Thu 9h + Fri 8h + Sat 9-1 (4h) = 44h ordinary, paid /44 hourly. NMW math: R1340/44 = R30.45 (passes R30.23).
- Saturday register entries are now part of the weekly run for sales (not saturday_cash).

**Run + recalculate routes:**
- Both routes load prior week's unapplied rollovers from `friday_ot_rollovers`, pass to engine, then stamp consumed rollovers as applied and upsert any newly produced.
- Recalculate scopes reset/delete to current employee_id (don't corrupt sibling rollover state).
- `isLastWeekOfMonth` now uses last-Friday-of-month consistently in both routes.
- Saturday attendance filter for the weekly engine: factory (< 44h) → routed to saturday_cash; sales (44h) → kept in weekly engine.

**SQL migrations applied to Pullens Supabase 14 May 2026:**
- 00007_ot_engine_v2.sql — schema (rollover table, new chk_nmw constraint per weekly_hours).
- 00008_sales_wage_uplift.sql — wages R1340 for 4 staff, audit_log entry per staff.
- Note: filename `00006` was already taken by `00006_id_document_url.sql` (added in a prior session), so 00007 + 00008 are the next slots, not 00006 + 00007 as the original plan stated.

**Infrastructure cleanup:**
- Orphan worktree `.claude/worktrees/payroll-workflow-redesign` deleted (full project copy from 11 May, was breaking `git status`). Branch ref, reflog, and `[branch ...]` config block removed.
- Git remote URL stripped of stale `annika-dev@` prefix — now `https://github.com/pullenstombstones09-lang/pullens-admin.git`.

**Commit chain on main:** `04a13d2` spec → `2e05a01` plan + cleanup → `28dc39d` vitest → `7d2d6f9` vitest fix → `7b2dc1d` mig 00007 → `9ceeaf8` type → `ccfce09` helpers → `d89cef2` engine rewrite → `af5cef6` run rollover → `9f18915` route fixes → `23aaea8` recalc rollover → `8472932` employee_id scoping + timezone → `e0e97b2` mig 00008 → `b7d32d1` Saturday filter + garnishee.

### TODO (next session / before Monday 25 May)
- [ ] Issue 2 — loans back-fill spec + implementation.
- [ ] Issue 4 — one-off anomalies (Tumelo, Randhir, Lungiswa, Aaron rounding).
- [ ] Smoke test Monday morning: hit Recalculate on the 4-8 May run; verify 8 factory staff now show OT; verify Nicolette/Faith/Gugu/Zandile wage shows R1340 on staff profile.
- [ ] Untracked files cleanup (`.claude/settings.local.json`, stray OHS docx, `scripts/seed-test-week.mjs`, `test-results/`).
- [ ] Add `passWithNoTests` TODO comment to `vitest.config.ts:8` (remove flag once tests are routinely present).

---

## Status — 11 May 2026 (session complete)

### SESSION WORK (11 May)

**Dev server fix:**
- `npm run dev` was crashing with OOM — fixed by adding `cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` to dev script in `package.json`
- Root cause: stale Node processes accumulating in memory

**PIN login fix:**
- PIN keypad was unresponsive — root cause was inline `<script>` in server component not firing reliably in Next.js 16 + Turbopack
- Rewrote `src/app/login/pin/page.tsx` as a client component with React state + `useSearchParams` wrapped in `<Suspense>`

**Payroll date selector fix:**
- Attendance check was hardcoded to current week — now uses selected `weekStart`/`weekEnd` dates
- Date picker was hidden entirely when no attendance found — now always visible with inline warning below instead
- Owner can now navigate to any past week and run payroll regardless of current week attendance state

**Undo toast fix:**
- `UndoToast` was calling `setUndo(null)` inside a `setElapsed` updater — React setState-in-render warning
- Fixed by moving `onExpire()` call into a separate `useEffect`

**Git remote fix:**
- Remote was authenticating as `yebokhaya` — fixed to `annika-dev@github.com/pullenstombstones09-lang/pullens-admin.git`
- Commits pushed: `5054ec6`, `049ef8a`

## Status — 7 May 2026 (session complete)

### CURRENT BUILD — main branch, deployed to Vercel

**Session work (7 May):** Payroll workflow polish, PDF fixes, banking page, payslip redesign, stale data alert, add employee fixes.

**Commits:** 9b93133 through e77ce8d

**Login screen fix:**
- Filtered to 7 admin users only (OS users no longer appear)
- Uses hardcoded ADMIN_NAMES list in `/api/auth/users` route
- OS users (Ali, Faith, Gugu, Sipho, Zandi, Randhir) are in shared Supabase but filtered out

**PDF fixes:**
- Em dash (—) crash in jsPDF fixed — replaced with hyphens in all PDF routes
- Null safety on all payslip fields
- Removed `payment_method` column reference (doesn't exist in DB)
- `createServiceRoleSupabase` now uses `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js` (true RLS bypass)

**Payslip PDF redesign (modern):**
- Proportional logo (40x20mm, not stretched)
- Pay period in readable format (Mon 05 May 2026)
- Employee info in clean grey card, two-column grid
- Royal blue table headers, alternating row stripes
- Net pay: white text on blue rounded box
- Employer UIF as italic footnote
- Signature lines at bottom
- One design used in Print All, Signing, and Individual preview

**Payroll workflow redesign:**
- Week calculation fixed: Mon-Fri (was wrong Fri-Thu)
- Workflow steps always visible, always clickable, show green tick when done
- Print step marks as printed on first tap, shows "Tap to reprint" after
- Workflow persists across navigation (loads existing run for current week)
- Removed duplicate "Print All Payslips" button and bottom action row
- Removed "Sign Payslips" from sidebar (accessible from workflow only)
- Tap employee row → opens individual payslip PDF in new tab (replaced checkboxes)
- Dashboard week progress reordered: Reg → Review → Payroll → Print → Bank → Sign

**Banking page fixes:**
- Employees start unticked (Lee-Ann ticks as she processes)
- Cash/EFT badge next to each employee (blue = EFT, amber = Cash)

**Payroll API fixes:**
- All payroll routes switched to `createServiceRoleSupabase` (RLS was blocking)
- Saturday payroll: fixed response key mismatch, added uif_employer, fixed print URL
- PH attendance records get crypto.randomUUID() (was null id crash)
- Register save: new records get crypto.randomUUID()
- Stale data alert: if attendance updated after payroll calculated, orange alert with Recalculate button
- Recalculate deletes old run + payslips, generates fresh — one payroll per week only

**Add Employee fixes:**
- Leave balances: fixed column names (annual_remaining, sick_remaining, family_remaining)
- Staff Type selector: Normal (40hr Mon-Fri) or Sales (45hr Mon-Sat)
- weekly_hours saved to employee on creation
- payment_method column added to DB (ALTER TABLE run manually)

**HR Advisor:**
- Advisor output now displays on employee Disciplinary tab (recommendation, action, legal basis)
- Generated PDF forms + digital signatures still TODO (noted in memory)

**45-hour sales staff:**
- 6 employees set to weekly_hours=45: Marlyn, Nicolette, Randhir, Gugu, Faith, Zandile
- Register already shows Saturday column for 45hr staff
- Saturday attendance (9:00-13:00) must be entered for correct payroll calc

**PWA install banner:**
- Shows once on first login (localStorage dismissed)
- Native install prompt on Android/Chrome, share instructions on iOS
- Manifest start_url changed to /dashboard

**Pullens OS note:**
- Added TODO in OS CLAUDE.md: create separate Supabase project before next build
- OS shares Supabase project with Admin — causes user leakage on login

### SQL MIGRATIONS — DONE
- 00001-00004: original schema (done 29 April)
- 00005: payroll_batch + payroll_type (run 5 May via Supabase SQL Editor)

### KNOWN BUGS (parked)
- Client component hydration fails on Vercel (login page was server component workaround)
- Seed route creates duplicate user rows on re-run (upsert ID is null when auth user exists)
- Loans/ folder with WhatsApp images is in git — reference photos for loan accounts, leave as-is

### NOT YET DONE
- [ ] **HR Advisor forms** — generated warning/hearing PDFs need save to employee profile + digital signature capture (employee + issuer + witness)
- [ ] **Petty cash overhaul** — daily view, monthly category breakdown, tick-to-square, month-over-month reporting
- [ ] **Monthly reporting** — payroll/attendance/petty cash summaries per month
- [ ] Payslip compliance: add leave balance, YTD totals (DO NOT TOUCH PAYE CALCULATION)
- [ ] Garnishee: add 25% net pay cap per Magistrates' Courts Act s65J
- [ ] Document template engine (filling HR pack Word templates)
- [ ] Thursday 16:00 petty cash cron trigger (Vercel cron)
- [ ] V12 parity testing (parallel run with old spreadsheet)
- [ ] Custom domain (admin.pullens.co.za) — non-blocking
- [ ] Clean up test pages (/test, /test2, /test3) and screenshot PNGs from repo
- [x] Worktree cleanup — `payroll-workflow-redesign` branch deleted 14 May 2026 (orphan dir, ref, reflog, config block, remote-tracking ref all removed)
- [ ] Delete duplicate Vercel project `pullens-admin-i4dp`
- [ ] Lungiswa Mpambane anomaly — verify attendance entered for correct week dates (Mon 5 May - Fri 9 May)
